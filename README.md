# CPPTest
This is a test branch to demonstrate gained knowledge in programming practices and ability.  
The calculator concept was chosen as this has the ability to provide some Abstraction, Interfaces,
Unit Tests, Test Drivers and a GUI implementation.

## CalculatorLibrary
Uses default ISO Standard C++14.  
Contains abstract class calculator, derived interface Standard calculator.

### Future tasks

- Implement Scientific Calculator.
- Implement Programmers Calculator.
- Implement factory class and methods for creating new Calculator Instances.

## CalculatorTestSuite
Uses default ISO Standard C++14.  
Uses Google Test classes for unit testing.

### Future Tasks

- Implement further tests for the test suite (Mix of TDD and BDD for Scientific and Programmer Calculators).
- Utilise GMock for mocking the Calculator instances.
- Calculate code coverage for the solution.
- Learn and implement QTTest for targeting QT specific implementation.

## TestApp
Uses default ISO Standard C++14.  
Defines a main.cpp for console based testing.

### Future Tasks

- Implement further test functionality of the CalculatorLibrary Classes.

## CalculatorGUI
Uses default ISO Standard C++14.  
Uses QT Widgets Version 6.3.0.

### Future Tasks

- Add interfaces for Scientfic Calculator and Programmer Calculator.
- Implement GUI using QML replacing widgets.
